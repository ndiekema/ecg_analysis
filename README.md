## Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the highest leading cause of death worldwide with an approximate
17.9 million related deaths every year according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Electrocardiographic (EKG or ECG) signals are electrical signals measured in the heart and are the main
indicator for pre-existing cardiac conditions. The application of deep learning methods such as artificial
neural networks (ANN) will assist in the automated detection and classification of ECG signals. The
current methods for ECG analysis are lacking in accuracy and reliability considering the level of risk
involved with CVDs and the importance of a correct diagnosis. Clinicians use ECG data to find irregular
patterns that may indicate the existence of potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions. The proposed
method uses the discrete wavelet transform for feature extraction and a feed-forward neural network for
the classification of six types of heart beats. This approach achieves impressive results in terms of
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across all classes. The best results obtained were 97.87%, 99.57%,
and 97.87%, respectively. Although simpler than other state-of-the-art methods, this approach achieves
competitive results and can help reduce the chance of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
